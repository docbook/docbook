<line remap="LINE">And now, to add more measure to your woes,</line>

<line remap="LINE">After the bloody fray at Wakefield fought,</line>
<line remap="LINE">Where your brave father breathed his latest gasp,</line>
<line remap="LINE">Tidings, as swiftly as the posts could run,</line>
<line remap="LINE">Were brought me of your loss and his depart.</line>
<line remap="LINE">I, then in London keeper of the king,</line>
<line remap="LINE">Muster'd my soldiers, gather'd flocks of friends,</line>

<line remap="LINE">March'd toward Saint Alban's to intercept the queen,</line>
<line remap="LINE">Bearing the king in my behalf along;</line>
<line remap="LINE">For by my scouts I was advertised</line>
<line remap="LINE">That she was coming with a full intent</line>
<line remap="LINE">To dash our late decree in parliament</line>
<line remap="LINE">Touching King Henry's oath and your succession.</line>
<line remap="LINE">Short tale to make, we at Saint Alban's met</line>
<line remap="LINE">Our battles join'd, and both sides fiercely fought:</line>
<line remap="LINE">But whether 'twas the coldness of the king,</line>
<line remap="LINE">Who look'd full gently on his warlike queen,</line>
<line remap="LINE">That robb'd my soldiers of their heated spleen;</line>
<line remap="LINE">Or whether 'twas report of her success;</line>
<line remap="LINE">Or more than common fear of Clifford's rigour,</line>
<line remap="LINE">Who thunders to his captives blood and death,</line>
<line remap="LINE">I cannot judge: but to conclude with truth,</line>
<line remap="LINE">Their weapons like to lightning came and went;</line>
<line remap="LINE">Our soldiers', like the night-owl's lazy flight,</line>
<line remap="LINE">Or like an idle thresher with a flail,</line>

<line remap="LINE">I cheer'd them up with justice of our cause,</line>
<line remap="LINE">With promise of high pay and great rewards:</line>
<line remap="LINE">But all in vain; they had no heart to fight,</line>
<line remap="LINE">And we in them no hope to win the day;</line>
<line remap="LINE">So that we fled; the king unto the queen;</line>
<line remap="LINE">Lord George your brother, Norfolk and myself,</line>

<line remap="LINE">Indeed, 'tis true that Henry told me of;</line>
<line remap="LINE">For I have often heard my mother say</line>
<line remap="LINE">I came into the world with my legs forward:</line>
<line remap="LINE">Had I not reason, think ye, to make haste,</line>
<line remap="LINE">And seek their ruin that usurp'd our right?</line>
<line remap="LINE">The midwife wonder'd and the women cried</line>
<line remap="LINE">'O, Jesus bless us, he is born with teeth!'</line>
<line remap="LINE">And so I was; which plainly signified</line>
<line remap="LINE">That I should snarl and bite and play the dog.</line>
<line remap="LINE">Then, since the heavens have shaped my body so,</line>
<line remap="LINE">Let hell make crook'd my mind to answer it.</line>
<line remap="LINE">I have no brother, I am like no brother;</line>
<line remap="LINE">And this word 'love,' which graybeards call divine,</line>
<line remap="LINE">Be resident in men like one another</line>
<line remap="LINE">And not in me: I am myself alone.</line>
<line remap="LINE">Clarence, beware; thou keep'st me from the light:</line>
<line remap="LINE">But I will sort a pitchy day for thee;</line>
<line remap="LINE">For I will buz abroad such prophecies</line>
<line remap="LINE">That Edward shall be fearful of his life,</line>
<line remap="LINE">And then, to purge his fear, I'll be thy death.</line>
<line remap="LINE">King Henry and the prince his son are gone:</line>
<line remap="LINE">Clarence, thy turn is next, and then the rest,</line>
<line remap="LINE">Counting myself but bad till I be best.</line>
<line remap="LINE">I'll throw thy body in another room</line>
<line remap="LINE">And triumph, Henry, in thy day of doom.</line>

<line remap="LINE">That in their chains fetter'd the kingly lion</line>
<line remap="LINE">And made the forest tremble when they roar'd.</line>
