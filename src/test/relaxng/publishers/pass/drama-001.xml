<speaker>KING HENRY V</speaker>
<line>What's he that wishes so?</line>
<line>My cousin Westmoreland? No, my fair cousin:</line>
<line>If we are mark'd to die, we are enow</line>
<line>To do our country loss; and if to live,</line>
<line>The fewer men, the greater share of honour.</line>
<line>God's will! I pray thee, wish not one man more.</line>
<line>By Jove, I am not covetous for gold,</line>
<line>Nor care I who doth feed upon my cost;</line>
<line>It yearns me not if men my garments wear;</line>
<line>Such outward things dwell not in my desires:</line>
<line>But if it be a sin to covet honour,</line>
<line>I am the most offending soul alive.</line>
<line>No, faith, my coz, wish not a man from England:</line>
<line>God's peace! I would not lose so great an honour</line>
<line>As one man more, methinks, would share from me</line>
<line>For the best hope I have. O, do not wish one more!</line>
<line>Rather proclaim it, Westmoreland, through my host,</line>
<line>That he which hath no stomach to this fight,</line>
<line>Let him depart; his passport shall be made</line>
<line>And crowns for convoy put into his purse:</line>
<line>We would not die in that man's company</line>
<line>That fears his fellowship to die with us.</line>
<line>This day is called the feast of Crispian:</line>
<line>He that outlives this day, and comes safe home,</line>
<line>Will stand a tip-toe when the day is named,</line>
<line>And rouse him at the name of Crispian.</line>
<line>He that shall live this day, and see old age,</line>
<line>Will yearly on the vigil feast his neighbours,</line>
<line>And say 'To-morrow is Saint Crispian:'</line>
<line>Then will he strip his sleeve and show his scars.</line>
<line>And say 'These wounds I had on Crispin's day.'</line>
<line>Old men forget: yet all shall be forgot,</line>
<line>But he'll remember with advantages</line>
<line>What feats he did that day: then shall our names.</line>
<line>Familiar in his mouth as household words</line>
<line>Harry the king, Bedford and Exeter,</line>
<line>Warwick and Talbot, Salisbury and Gloucester,</line>
<line>Be in their flowing cups freshly remember'd.</line>
<line>This story shall the good man teach his son;</line>
<line>And Crispin Crispian shall ne'er go by,</line>
<line>From this day to the ending of the world,</line>
<line>But we in it shall be remember'd;</line>
<line>We few, we happy few, we band of brothers;</line>
<line>For he to-day that sheds his blood with me</line>
<line>Shall be my brother; be he ne'er so vile,</line>
<line>This day shall gentle his condition:</line>
<line>And gentlemen in England now a-bed</line>
<line>Shall think themselves accursed they were not here,</line>
<line>And hold their manhoods cheap whiles any speaks</line>
<line>That fought with us upon Saint Crispin's day.</line>
