* DONE Add information about referencing schemas used in customizations
Hi,

I am wondering if there is an "official URI" for DocBook 5, especially for 
using it inside an include element.

Consider someone is customizing DocBook 5 and want to include the RELAX NG 
Schema:

  include "docbook.rnc" { ... }
           ^^^^^^^^^^^

Sometimes I see a path here which I consider bad style because it is 
platform dependend. How can I reference to the DocBook 5 Schema 
officially? Are there any plans on this? Or is the DocBook TC consider 
this out of scope? I couldn't find anything in this regard in the DocBook 
V5.0 Howto. 


Thanks,
Tom

Gentlemen,

  I am trying to read the subject guide via html and find it most difficult because of the formatting.   The problem is that the display is much too wide and causes horizontal scrolling.  This is because the contents of the line:

<pre class="screen"><span class="command"><strong>
java -Dorg.apache.xerces.xni.parser.XMLParserConfiguration=org.apache.xerces.parsers.XIncludeParserConfiguration -jar /path/to/oNVDL/bin/onvdl.jar /path/to/docbook.nvdl document.xml
...

are all on one line (182 characters!) and the browser does not wrap <pre> constructs.  The problem of excessive line length also exists in the pdf version of the book.

At the Linux From Scratch project we have been using DocBook for several years and have found the best practice to be to limit any <screen> elements to 76 characters or less.  This may not be possible in your case as the define is quite long, but how about breaking at before the -jar portion of the line?


Thanks for your attention.
