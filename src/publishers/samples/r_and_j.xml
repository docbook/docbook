<line remap="LINE">You, to remove that siege of grief from her,</line>

<line remap="LINE">To rid her from this second marriage,</line>
<line remap="LINE">Or in my cell there would she kill herself.</line>
<line remap="LINE">Then gave I her, so tutor'd by my art,</line>
<line remap="LINE">A sleeping potion; which so took effect</line>
<line remap="LINE">As I intended, for it wrought on her</line>
