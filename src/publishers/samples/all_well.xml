<line remap="LINE">There's little can be said in 't; 'tis against the</line>

<line remap="LINE">is to accuse your mothers; which is most infallible</line>
<line remap="LINE">disobedience. He that hangs himself is a virgin:</line>
<line remap="LINE">virginity murders itself and should be buried in</line>
<line remap="LINE">highways out of all sanctified limit, as a desperate</line>
<line remap="LINE">offendress against nature. Virginity breeds mites,</line>
<line remap="LINE">much like a cheese; consumes itself to the very</line>
<line remap="LINE">paring, and so dies with feeding his own stomach.</line>
<line remap="LINE">Besides, virginity is peevish, proud, idle, made of</line>
<line remap="LINE">self-love, which is the most inhibited sin in the</line>
<line remap="LINE">canon. Keep it not; you cannot choose but loose</line>
<line remap="LINE">by't: out with 't! within ten year it will make</line>
<line remap="LINE">itself ten, which is a goodly increase; and the</line>
