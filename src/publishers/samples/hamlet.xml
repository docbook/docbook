<line remap="LINE">Well ratified by law and heraldry,</line>

<line remap="LINE">The virtue of his will: but you must fear,</line>
<line remap="LINE">His greatness weigh'd, his will is not his own;</line>
<line remap="LINE">For he himself is subject to his birth:</line>

<line remap="LINE">Carve for himself; for on his choice depends</line>
<line remap="LINE">The safety and health of this whole state;</line>
<line remap="LINE">And therefore must his choice be circumscribed</line>
<line remap="LINE">Unto the voice and yielding of that body</line>
<line remap="LINE">Whereof he is the head. Then if he says he loves you,</line>
<line remap="LINE">It fits your wisdom so far to believe it</line>
