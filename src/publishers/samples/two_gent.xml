<line remap="LINE">When a man's servant shall play the cur with him,</line>
<line remap="LINE">look you, it goes hard: one that I brought up of a</line>
<line remap="LINE">puppy; one that I saved from drowning, when three or</line>
<line remap="LINE">four of his blind brothers and sisters went to it.</line>
<line remap="LINE">I have taught him, even as one would say precisely,</line>
<line remap="LINE">'thus I would teach a dog.' I was sent to deliver</line>
<line remap="LINE">him as a present to Mistress Silvia from my master;</line>
<line remap="LINE">and I came no sooner into the dining-chamber but he</line>
<line remap="LINE">steps me to her trencher and steals her capon's leg:</line>
<line remap="LINE">O, 'tis a foul thing when a cur cannot keep himself</line>
<line remap="LINE">in all companies! I would have, as one should say,</line>
<line remap="LINE">one that takes upon him to be a dog indeed, to be,</line>
<line remap="LINE">as it were, a dog at all things. If I had not had</line>
<line remap="LINE">more wit than he, to take a fault upon me that he did,</line>
<line remap="LINE">I think verily he had been hanged for't; sure as I</line>
<line remap="LINE">live, he had suffered for't; you shall judge. He</line>
<line remap="LINE">thrusts me himself into the company of three or four</line>
<line remap="LINE">gentlemanlike dogs under the duke's table: he had</line>
<line remap="LINE">not been there--bless the mark!--a pissing while, but</line>
<line remap="LINE">all the chamber smelt him. 'Out with the dog!' says</line>
<line remap="LINE">one: 'What cur is that?' says another: 'Whip him</line>
<line remap="LINE">out' says the third: 'Hang him up' says the duke.</line>
<line remap="LINE">I, having been acquainted with the smell before,</line>
<line remap="LINE">knew it was Crab, and goes me to the fellow that</line>
<line remap="LINE">whips the dogs: 'Friend,' quoth I, 'you mean to whip</line>
<line remap="LINE">the dog?' 'Ay, marry, do I,' quoth he. 'You do him</line>
<line remap="LINE">the more wrong,' quoth I; ''twas I did the thing you</line>
<line remap="LINE">wot of.' He makes me no more ado, but whips me out</line>
<line remap="LINE">of the chamber. How many masters would do this for</line>
<line remap="LINE">his servant? Nay, I'll be sworn, I have sat in the</line>
<line remap="LINE">stocks for puddings he hath stolen, otherwise he had</line>
<line remap="LINE">been executed; I have stood on the pillory for geese</line>
<line remap="LINE">he hath killed, otherwise he had suffered for't.</line>
<line remap="LINE">Thou thinkest not of this now. Nay, I remember the</line>
<line remap="LINE">trick you served me when I took my leave of Madam</line>
