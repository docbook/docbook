<line remap="LINE">As I remember, Adam, it was upon this fashion</line>
<line remap="LINE">bequeathed me by will but poor a thousand crowns,</line>
<line remap="LINE">and, as thou sayest, charged my brother, on his</line>
<line remap="LINE">blessing, to breed me well: and there begins my</line>
<line remap="LINE">sadness. My brother Jaques he keeps at school, and</line>
<line remap="LINE">report speaks goldenly of his profit: for my part,</line>
<line remap="LINE">he keeps me rustically at home, or, to speak more</line>
<line remap="LINE">properly, stays me here at home unkept; for call you</line>
<line remap="LINE">that keeping for a gentleman of my birth, that</line>
<line remap="LINE">differs not from the stalling of an ox? His horses</line>
<line remap="LINE">are bred better; for, besides that they are fair</line>
<line remap="LINE">with their feeding, they are taught their manage,</line>
<line remap="LINE">and to that end riders dearly hired: but I, his</line>
<line remap="LINE">brother, gain nothing under him but growth; for the</line>
<line remap="LINE">which his animals on his dunghills are as much</line>
<line remap="LINE">bound to him as I. Besides this nothing that he so</line>
<line remap="LINE">plentifully gives me, the something that nature gave</line>
<line remap="LINE">me his countenance seems to take from me: he lets</line>
<line remap="LINE">me feed with his hinds, bars me the place of a</line>
<line remap="LINE">brother, and, as much as in him lies, mines my</line>
<line remap="LINE">gentility with my education. This is it, Adam, that</line>
<line remap="LINE">grieves me; and the spirit of my father, which I</line>
<line remap="LINE">think is within me, begins to mutiny against this</line>

<line remap="LINE">A motley fool; a miserable world!</line>
<line remap="LINE">As I do live by food, I met a fool</line>
<line remap="LINE">Who laid him down and bask'd him in the sun,</line>
<line remap="LINE">And rail'd on Lady Fortune in good terms,</line>
<line remap="LINE">In good set terms and yet a motley fool.</line>
<line remap="LINE">'Good morrow, fool,' quoth I. 'No, sir,' quoth he,</line>
<line remap="LINE">'Call me not fool till heaven hath sent me fortune:'</line>
<line remap="LINE">And then he drew a dial from his poke,</line>
<line remap="LINE">And, looking on it with lack-lustre eye,</line>
<line remap="LINE">Says very wisely, 'It is ten o'clock:</line>
<line remap="LINE">Thus we may see,' quoth he, 'how the world wags:</line>
<line remap="LINE">'Tis but an hour ago since it was nine,</line>
<line remap="LINE">And after one hour more 'twill be eleven;</line>
<line remap="LINE">And so, from hour to hour, we ripe and ripe,</line>
<line remap="LINE">And then, from hour to hour, we rot and rot;</line>
<line remap="LINE">And thereby hangs a tale.' When I did hear</line>
<line remap="LINE">The motley fool thus moral on the time,</line>
<line remap="LINE">My lungs began to crow like chanticleer,</line>
<line remap="LINE">That fools should be so deep-contemplative,</line>
<line remap="LINE">And I did laugh sans intermission</line>
<line remap="LINE">An hour by his dial. O noble fool!</line>

<line remap="LINE">I am the second son of old Sir Rowland,</line>
<line remap="LINE">That bring these tidings to this fair assembly.</line>
<line remap="LINE">Duke Frederick, hearing how that every day</line>
<line remap="LINE">Men of great worth resorted to this forest,</line>
<line remap="LINE">Address'd a mighty power; which were on foot,</line>
<line remap="LINE">In his own conduct, purposely to take</line>
<line remap="LINE">His brother here and put him to the sword:</line>
<line remap="LINE">And to the skirts of this wild wood he came;</line>
<line remap="LINE">Where meeting with an old religious man,</line>
<line remap="LINE">After some question with him, was converted</line>
<line remap="LINE">Both from his enterprise and from the world,</line>
<line remap="LINE">His crown bequeathing to his banish'd brother,</line>
<line remap="LINE">And all their lands restored to them again</line>
<line remap="LINE">That were with him exiled. This to be true,</line>
<line remap="LINE">I do engage my life.</line>

<line remap="LINE">First, in this forest, let us do those ends</line>

<line remap="LINE">It is not the fashion to see the lady the epilogue;</line>
<line remap="LINE">but it is no more unhandsome than to see the lord</line>
<line remap="LINE">the prologue. If it be true that good wine needs</line>
<line remap="LINE">no bush, 'tis true that a good play needs no</line>
<line remap="LINE">epilogue; yet to good wine they do use good bushes,</line>
<line remap="LINE">and good plays prove the better by the help of good</line>
<line remap="LINE">epilogues. What a case am I in then, that am</line>
<line remap="LINE">neither a good epilogue nor cannot insinuate with</line>
<line remap="LINE">you in the behalf of a good play! I am not</line>
<line remap="LINE">furnished like a beggar, therefore to beg will not</line>
<line remap="LINE">become me: my way is to conjure you; and I'll begin</line>
<line remap="LINE">with the women. I charge you, O women, for the love</line>
<line remap="LINE">you bear to men, to like as much of this play as</line>
<line remap="LINE">please you: and I charge you, O men, for the love</line>
<line remap="LINE">you bear to women--as I perceive by your simpering,</line>
<line remap="LINE">none of you hates them--that between you and the</line>
<line remap="LINE">women the play may please. If I were a woman I</line>
<line remap="LINE">would kiss as many of you as had beards that pleased</line>
<line remap="LINE">me, complexions that liked me and breaths that I</line>
<line remap="LINE">defied not: and, I am sure, as many as have good</line>
<line remap="LINE">beards or good faces or sweet breaths will, for my</line>
<line remap="LINE">kind offer, when I make curtsy, bid me farewell.</line>
