<line remap="LINE">I come no more to make you laugh: things now,</line>
<line remap="LINE">That bear a weighty and a serious brow,</line>
<line remap="LINE">Sad, high, and working, full of state and woe,</line>
<line remap="LINE">Such noble scenes as draw the eye to flow,</line>
<line remap="LINE">We now present. Those that can pity, here</line>
<line remap="LINE">May, if they think it well, let fall a tear;</line>
<line remap="LINE">The subject will deserve it. Such as give</line>
<line remap="LINE">Their money out of hope they may believe,</line>
<line remap="LINE">May here find truth too. Those that come to see</line>
<line remap="LINE">Only a show or two, and so agree</line>
<line remap="LINE">The play may pass, if they be still and willing,</line>
<line remap="LINE">I'll undertake may see away their shilling</line>
<line remap="LINE">Richly in two short hours. Only they</line>
<line remap="LINE">That come to hear a merry bawdy play,</line>
<line remap="LINE">A noise of targets, or to see a fellow</line>
<line remap="LINE">In a long motley coat guarded with yellow,</line>
<line remap="LINE">Will be deceived; for, gentle hearers, know,</line>
<line remap="LINE">To rank our chosen truth with such a show</line>
<line remap="LINE">As fool and fight is, beside forfeiting</line>
<line remap="LINE">Our own brains, and the opinion that we bring,</line>
<line remap="LINE">To make that only true we now intend,</line>
<line remap="LINE">Will leave us never an understanding friend.</line>
<line remap="LINE">Therefore, for goodness' sake, and as you are known</line>
<line remap="LINE">The first and happiest hearers of the town,</line>
<line remap="LINE">Be sad, as we would make ye: think ye see</line>
<line remap="LINE">The very persons of our noble story</line>
<line remap="LINE">As they were living; think you see them great,</line>
<line remap="LINE">And follow'd with the general throng and sweat</line>
<line remap="LINE">Of thousand friends; then in a moment, see</line>
<line remap="LINE">How soon this mightiness meets misery:</line>
<line remap="LINE">And, if you can be merry then, I'll say</line>
<line remap="LINE">A man may weep upon his wedding-day.</line>

<line remap="LINE">Show'd like a mine. Their dwarfish pages were</line>
<line remap="LINE">As cherubins, all guilt: the madams too,</line>
<line remap="LINE">Not used to toil, did almost sweat to bear</line>
<line remap="LINE">The pride upon them, that their very labour</line>
<line remap="LINE">Was to them as a painting: now this masque</line>
<line remap="LINE">Was cried incomparable; and the ensuing night</line>
<line remap="LINE">Made it a fool and beggar. The two kings,</line>

<line remap="LINE">The devil speed him! no man's pie is freed</line>

<line remap="LINE">For high feats done to the crown; neither allied</line>
<line remap="LINE">For eminent assistants; but, spider-like,</line>
<line remap="LINE">Out of his self-drawing web, he gives us note,</line>

<line remap="LINE">Without the privity o' the king, to appoint</line>
<line remap="LINE">Who should attend on him? He makes up the file</line>
<line remap="LINE">Of all the gentry; for the most part such</line>
<line remap="LINE">To whom as great a charge as little honour</line>
<line remap="LINE">He meant to lay upon: and his own letter,</line>

<line remap="LINE">I'll tell you in a little. The great duke</line>
<line remap="LINE">Came to the bar; where to his accusations</line>
<line remap="LINE">He pleaded still not guilty and alleged</line>
<line remap="LINE">Many sharp reasons to defeat the law.</line>
<line remap="LINE">The king's attorney on the contrary</line>
<line remap="LINE">Urged on the examinations, proofs, confessions</line>

<line remap="LINE">The same.</line>
<line remap="LINE">All these accused him strongly; which he fain</line>
<line remap="LINE">Would have flung from him, but, indeed, he could not:</line>
<line remap="LINE">And so his peers, upon this evidence,</line>
<line remap="LINE">Have found him guilty of high treason. Much</line>
<line remap="LINE">He spoke, and learnedly, for life; but all</line>

<line remap="LINE">Restored me to my honours, and, out of ruins,</line>

<line remap="LINE">Henry the Eighth, life, honour, name and all</line>
<line remap="LINE">That made me happy at one stroke has taken</line>

<line remap="LINE">The least rub in your fortunes, fall away</line>
<line remap="LINE">Like water from ye, never found again</line>
<line remap="LINE">But where they mean to sink ye. All good people,</line>

<line remap="LINE">Of my long weary life is come upon me. Farewell:</line>

<line remap="LINE">Sir, I desire you do me right and justice;</line>
<line remap="LINE">And to bestow your pity on me: for</line>
<line remap="LINE">I am a most poor woman, and a stranger,</line>
<line remap="LINE">Born out of your dominions; having here</line>

<line remap="LINE">He were mine enemy? what friend of mine</line>
<line remap="LINE">That had to him derived your anger, did I</line>
<line remap="LINE">Continue in my liking? nay, gave notice</line>
<line remap="LINE">He was from thence discharged. Sir, call to mind</line>
<line remap="LINE">That I have been your wife, in this obedience,</line>
<line remap="LINE">Upward of twenty years, and have been blest</line>
<line remap="LINE">With many children by you: if, in the course</line>

<line remap="LINE">My bond to wedlock, or my love and duty,</line>
<line remap="LINE">Against your sacred person, in God's name,</line>
<line remap="LINE">Turn me away; and let the foul'st contempt</line>
<line remap="LINE">Shut door upon me, and so give me up</line>
<line remap="LINE">To the sharp'st kind of justice. Please you sir,</line>
<line remap="LINE">The king, your father, was reputed for</line>
<line remap="LINE">A prince most prudent, of an excellent</line>

<line remap="LINE">That you have many enemies, that know not</line>

<line remap="LINE">Bark when their fellows do: by some of these</line>
<line remap="LINE">The queen is put in anger. You're excused:</line>
<line remap="LINE">But will you be more justified? You ever</line>
<line remap="LINE">Have wish'd the sleeping of this business; never desired</line>
<line remap="LINE">It to be stirr'd; but oft have hinder'd, oft,</line>
<line remap="LINE">The passages made toward it: on my honour,</line>
<line remap="LINE">I speak my good lord cardinal to this point,</line>
<line remap="LINE">And thus far clear him. Now, what moved me to't,</line>
<line remap="LINE">I will be bold with time and your attention:</line>
<line remap="LINE">Then mark the inducement. Thus it came; give heed to't:</line>
<line remap="LINE">My conscience first received a tenderness,</line>
<line remap="LINE">Scruple, and prick, on certain speeches utter'd</line>
<line remap="LINE">By the Bishop of Bayonne, then French ambassador;</line>
<line remap="LINE">Who had been hither sent on the debating</line>
<line remap="LINE">A marriage 'twixt the Duke of Orleans and</line>
<line remap="LINE">Our daughter Mary: i' the progress of this business,</line>
<line remap="LINE">Ere a determinate resolution, he,</line>
<line remap="LINE">I mean the bishop, did require a respite;</line>
<line remap="LINE">Wherein he might the king his lord advertise</line>
<line remap="LINE">Whether our daughter were legitimate,</line>
<line remap="LINE">Respecting this our marriage with the dowager,</line>
<line remap="LINE">Sometimes our brother's wife. This respite shook</line>
<line remap="LINE">The bosom of my conscience, enter'd me,</line>
<line remap="LINE">Yea, with a splitting power, and made to tremble</line>
<line remap="LINE">The region of my breast; which forced such way,</line>
<line remap="LINE">That many mazed considerings did throng</line>
<line remap="LINE">And press'd in with this caution. First, methought</line>
<line remap="LINE">I stood not in the smile of heaven; who had</line>
<line remap="LINE">Commanded nature, that my lady's womb,</line>
<line remap="LINE">If it conceived a male child by me, should</line>
<line remap="LINE">Do no more offices of life to't than</line>
<line remap="LINE">The grave does to the dead; for her male issue</line>
<line remap="LINE">Or died where they were made, or shortly after</line>
<line remap="LINE">This world had air'd them: hence I took a thought,</line>
<line remap="LINE">This was a judgment on me; that my kingdom,</line>
<line remap="LINE">Well worthy the best heir o' the world, should not</line>
<line remap="LINE">Be gladded in't by me: then follows, that</line>
<line remap="LINE">I weigh'd the danger which my realms stood in</line>
<line remap="LINE">By this my issue's fail; and that gave to me</line>
<line remap="LINE">Many a groaning throe. Thus hulling in</line>
<line remap="LINE">The wild sea of my conscience, I did steer</line>
<line remap="LINE">Toward this remedy, whereupon we are</line>
<line remap="LINE">Now present here together: that's to say,</line>
<line remap="LINE">I meant to rectify my conscience,--which</line>
<line remap="LINE">I then did feel full sick, and yet not well,--</line>

<line remap="LINE">For after the stout Earl Northumberland</line>
<line remap="LINE">Arrested him at York, and brought him forward,</line>
<line remap="LINE">As a man sorely tainted, to his answer,</line>

<speaker remap="SPEAKER">GRIFFITH</speaker>
<line remap="LINE">At last, with easy roads, he came to Leicester,</line>
<line remap="LINE">Lodged in the abbey; where the reverend abbot,</line>

<line remap="LINE">To whom he gave these words, 'O, father abbot,</line>
<line remap="LINE">An old man, broken with the storms of state,</line>
<line remap="LINE">Is come to lay his weary bones among ye;</line>
<line remap="LINE">Give him a little earth for charity!'</line>

<line remap="LINE">About the hour of eight, which he himself</line>
<line remap="LINE">Foretold should be his last, full of repentance,</line>

<line remap="LINE">Himself with princes; one that, by suggestion,</line>
<line remap="LINE">Tied all the kingdom: simony was fair-play;</line>
<line remap="LINE">His own opinion was his law: i' the presence</line>
<line remap="LINE">He would say untruths; and be ever double</line>
<line remap="LINE">Both in his words and meaning: he was never,</line>
<line remap="LINE">But where he meant to ruin, pitiful:</line>
<line remap="LINE">His promises were, as he then was, mighty;</line>

<line remap="LINE">Let me speak, sir,</line>
<line remap="LINE">For heaven now bids me; and the words I utter</line>
<line remap="LINE">Let none think flattery, for they'll find 'em truth.</line>
<line remap="LINE">This royal infant--heaven still move about her!--</line>
<line remap="LINE">Though in her cradle, yet now promises</line>
<line remap="LINE">Upon this land a thousand thousand blessings,</line>
<line remap="LINE">Which time shall bring to ripeness: she shall be--</line>
<line remap="LINE">But few now living can behold that goodness--</line>
<line remap="LINE">A pattern to all princes living with her,</line>
<line remap="LINE">And all that shall succeed: Saba was never</line>
<line remap="LINE">More covetous of wisdom and fair virtue</line>
<line remap="LINE">Than this pure soul shall be: all princely graces,</line>
<line remap="LINE">That mould up such a mighty piece as this is,</line>
<line remap="LINE">With all the virtues that attend the good,</line>
<line remap="LINE">Shall still be doubled on her: truth shall nurse her,</line>
<line remap="LINE">Holy and heavenly thoughts still counsel her:</line>
<line remap="LINE">She shall be loved and fear'd: her own shall bless her;</line>
<line remap="LINE">Her foes shake like a field of beaten corn,</line>
<line remap="LINE">And hang their heads with sorrow: good grows with her:</line>
<line remap="LINE">In her days every man shall eat in safety,</line>
<line remap="LINE">Under his own vine, what he plants; and sing</line>
<line remap="LINE">The merry songs of peace to all his neighbours:</line>
<line remap="LINE">God shall be truly known; and those about her</line>
<line remap="LINE">From her shall read the perfect ways of honour,</line>
<line remap="LINE">And by those claim their greatness, not by blood.</line>
<line remap="LINE">Nor shall this peace sleep with her: but as when</line>
<line remap="LINE">The bird of wonder dies, the maiden phoenix,</line>
<line remap="LINE">Her ashes new create another heir,</line>
<line remap="LINE">As great in admiration as herself;</line>
<line remap="LINE">So shall she leave her blessedness to one,</line>
<line remap="LINE">When heaven shall call her from this cloud of darkness,</line>
<line remap="LINE">Who from the sacred ashes of her honour</line>
<line remap="LINE">Shall star-like rise, as great in fame as she was,</line>
<line remap="LINE">And so stand fix'd: peace, plenty, love, truth, terror,</line>
<line remap="LINE">That were the servants to this chosen infant,</line>
<line remap="LINE">Shall then be his, and like a vine grow to him:</line>
<line remap="LINE">Wherever the bright sun of heaven shall shine,</line>
<line remap="LINE">His honour and the greatness of his name</line>
<line remap="LINE">Shall be, and make new nations: he shall flourish,</line>
<line remap="LINE">And, like a mountain cedar, reach his branches</line>
<line remap="LINE">To all the plains about him: our children's children</line>
<line remap="LINE">Shall see this, and bless heaven.</line>

<line remap="LINE">O lord archbishop,</line>
<line remap="LINE">Thou hast made me now a man! never, before</line>
<line remap="LINE">This happy child, did I get any thing:</line>
<line remap="LINE">This oracle of comfort has so pleased me,</line>
<line remap="LINE">That when I am in heaven I shall desire</line>
<line remap="LINE">To see what this child does, and praise my Maker.</line>
<line remap="LINE">I thank ye all. To you, my good lord mayor,</line>
<line remap="LINE">And your good brethren, I am much beholding;</line>
<line remap="LINE">I have received much honour by your presence,</line>
<line remap="LINE">And ye shall find me thankful. Lead the way, lords:</line>
<line remap="LINE">Ye must all see the queen, and she must thank ye,</line>
<line remap="LINE">She will be sick else. This day, no man think</line>
<line remap="LINE">Has business at his house; for all shall stay:</line>
<line remap="LINE">This little one shall make it holiday.</line>

<line remap="LINE">All that are here: some come to take their ease,</line>

<line remap="LINE">We have frighted with our trumpets; so, 'tis clear,</line>
<line remap="LINE">They'll say 'tis naught: others, to hear the city</line>
<line remap="LINE">Abused extremely, and to cry 'That's witty!'</line>

<line remap="LINE">All the expected good we're like to hear</line>
