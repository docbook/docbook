<abstract>
<para>DocBook is a general purpose <xref linkend="xml-rec"/> schema
particularly well suited to books and papers about computer hardware
and software (though it is by no means limited to these applications).
</para>
<para>The Version 5.1 release introduces assemblies for topic-oriented
authoring. It also addresses a selection of bugs and feature requests.
</para>
<para>The Technical Committee provides the DocBook 5.1 schema in other
schema languages, including W3C XML Schema and an
XML DTD, but the RELAX NG Schema is the normative schema.</para>
