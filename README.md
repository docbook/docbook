# The DocBook Schemas

This repository contains the sources for the DocBook schemas. All of
the revision history from the Sourceforge days has been preserved.

# The `docbook-5.1.x` branch

This branch contains patches on top of the `docbook-5.1` branch.

1. The build tools have been updated.
2. A small set of patches have been applied to several schemas to make
    them consistent with the last-published 5.1CR3 versions. It is not
    clear how they became divergent. The following schemas have been
    updated:
    * Publishers
    * Slides Full
    * Website Full
